# FontInstaller
Linux font installer

## To Install:
Just rename it to whatever you like, removing the .sh suffix, eg:
`$ mv infont.sh infont`

Now, move it to `/usr/bin/` or anywhere you keep your binaries with:
`$ sudo mv /path/to/infont /your/binaries/folder`

## Useage

It's quite simple, just do:
`$ infont -f /path/to/font`
and it will do everything automatically for you, no need for a gui :)
it will also print the useful info to ther terminal after it has moved it.

`$ cat /usr/bin/infont`
